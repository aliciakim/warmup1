### 1. Star Wars

A quote by Kazuda Xiono:

### 2. Cooking Recipe

The ***Smitten Kitchen*** recipe I chose was [this](https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/01/cabbage-and-sausage-casserole/) cabbage and sausage casserole. This dish is great for the cold weather months. You can also add spices and aromatic additions such as tomatoes, bacon bits, herbs and so on. You can serve it with mustard and bread as tasty additions, too!

##### Ingredients List

-   Salt
-   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
-   1 pound fresh sweet Italian pork sausages or bulk sausage meat
-   1 large green or Savoy cabbage (2 pounds), cored and thickly shredded
-   Freshly ground black pepper
-   Crusty bread and coarse mustard, for serving

##### Kitchen Tools

-   9-13-2 baking dish
-   colander
-   aluminum foil
-   oven

##### Recipe Steps

1.  Heat oven to 300 degrees. Bring large pot of salty water to boil and butter the baking dish. Discard casing on sausages if necessary.
2.  Place cabbage in boiling water and bring to a boil. Uncover and boil for 3 minutes. Drain cabbage in colander, running cold water to stop it from cooking.
3.  Put 1/3 of cabbage in buttered dish, then cover with 1/2 the meat. Then sprinkle with salt and pepper and dot with butter. Repeat with cabbage and meat and final layer of cabbage. Dot top with butter.
4.  Cover dish with aluminum foil. Cook for about 2 1/2 hours until cabbage is soft and sweet and top is lightly browned. After 2 hours uncover dish and check if liquid has pooled at bottom. If liquid exists, leave uncovered for rest of cooking time. Otherwise, recover.

### 3. Euclidean Distance

##### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Euclidean distance between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them (pq).

In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>,..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and q = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>,..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$ d(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}) = d(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + ... + (q\_n - p\_n)^2}$$
$$ = \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^n (q\_i - p\_i)^2)}$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, p and q may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or Euclidean length, or magnitude of a vector measures the length of the vector.

$$ \\lVert \\mathbf{p} \\rVert = \\sqrt{(p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + ... + p\_n^2)} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}}, $$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
